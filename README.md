# "What Makes a Patch Distinct?": An Attempt

This is my final for B457 Computer Vision, instructed by Alimoor Reza at Indiana University in the Spring of 2021. The file `paper.pdf` discusses the project in-depth, so it will not be reproduced in this README file. The `poster.pdf` file contains the slides from when the project was presented. Unfortunately, I do not have a recording of the presentation itself.

The code and input/output files can be found in the `/materials` directory. `main.py` contains all of the code. This is a re-upload for personal posterity, but I believe the dependencies are `scikit-learn`, `scikit-image`, `Pillow`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.
